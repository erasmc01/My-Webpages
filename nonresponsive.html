                b</a> is comparable to that of our own Earth for countless reasons hence receiving its name. Below is
            listed
            the features that make it the new 'super-Earth'.</p>

                        Because of its layout it
                        received its
                        name as
                        'super-Earth' indicating a larger size. Despite its size, this newly discovered planet only
                        takes
                        19 days
                        to
                        orbit its parent star while it takes a considerable 365 days for Earth to orbit the Sun.</p>

                        it being
                        a red dwarf star, planets like TOI-715 b can crowd closer and still be without risk within the

            <h2>Is Exterrestrial Life A Possibility?</h2>
            <p>Because of TOI-715 b being located in the habitable zone of its parent star (TOI-715), the question for
                exterrestial life outside of Earth debated. With more technological tools and facilities that guide
                astronomers into discovering planets within habitable zones, the search for exterrersital life in
                habitable
                zones remains a topic to be discussed. The next steps in this discovery would be to confirm planet
                TOI-715
                as a habitable planet with water liquid and the potential for it to support life.</p>

            <p>This 'super-Earth' was discovered by Tess, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The
                international
                team of scientists who made the discovery was led by Georgina Dransfield from the University of
                Birmingham, United Kingdom.</p>
